I made a video, using [Gource](https://code.google.com/p/gource/), that visualizes the git history from my first hackathon project.

The hackathon was a tremendously empowering experience. I learned the [Google Chart API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and was excited to learn as I read the documentation that I easily understood it.  This is defiantly a credit to the quality of the documentation, but it also let me get a good idea of how much I had been able to learn in a short time.  

If you're interested in seeing the code behind the project, you can find it [here](https://github.com/zedwarth/deathclock).  If you want to see what my team built, look [here](http://meetyourmaker.herokuapp.com).
