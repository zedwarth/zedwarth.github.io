Tomorrow morning is my first [Steel City Ruby Conference!](http://www.steelcityruby.org) and I'm really excited!  When I was in Austin going to school at [MakerSquare](http://www.makersquare.com) it was easier to be connected to fellow programmers.  Because I was going to school with a bunch of them, yes, but also because I was living in the city and it was really easy to head over to Capital Factory for the local Rails Meetup.

Since moving back home to Pittsburgh it's been harder, especially since I'm not living in the city and don't have classmates pressuring me to hangout.  

Tomorrow I'm hoping to learn a bunch a cool things, but I'm also looking forward to the synergy of being around lots of passionate developers.
